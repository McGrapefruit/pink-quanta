## Definition

##### Gall's law

> “A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. **A complex system designed from scratch never works** and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.”
> – John Gall

Only fools and modern technocrats try to create complex systems from scratch!
