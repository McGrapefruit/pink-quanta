Syntopy is the fusion of different qualities into a new whole.

Syntopy suggests that two formally unrelated qualities are brought together at one location (which can also happen in ones mind) to form a new quality of some sort. This creates space for a special milieu of new and unexpected elements...



There is no universally accepted definition of the concept of syntopy. In neuroscience, the term "syntopy" was coined by [Prof. Dr. Ernst PÃ¶ppel](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_P%C3%B6ppel) at the Institute for Medical Psychology of LMU Munich.
