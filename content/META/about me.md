##### Now

I currently work at [DataHall](https://datahall.de) as Head of Communication.
We are a [[Holacracy|holocratic]] team of planners with the ambitious vision of building the most innovative datacenter in Europe. 
We are still in stealth mode, a new website and marketing is coming soon!

##### Who I am

![[about me-20240721034345767.jpg|600]]


Although I am "only" 30 years old, my 12 years of professional experience have afforded me the privilege of navigating a diverse array of careers and sectors, often encountering situations that are uncommon for someone of my age.


I do not claim expertise in the topics I explore within this *digital garden* - **I am a generalist inspired by the insights of experts**.


I consider myself a jack-of-all-trades and debater [(ENTP)](https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality). 
My curiosity spans multiple fields, learning is something I deeply enjoy.

My academic background lies in psychology, with a focus on communication and interaction, a foundation that informs my current work as ~~interdisziplinary~~ transdisziplinary communicator â€“ I help to communicate and aggregate.

I am a system thinker.
