##### Now

I currently work at [DataHall](https://datahall.de) as Head of Communication.
We are a [[Holacracy|holocratic]] team of planners with the ambitious vision of building the most innovative datacenter in Europe. We are still in stealth mode, a new website and marketing is coming soon!

##### Who I am

![[about me-20240721034345767.jpg|600]]


Although I am "only" 30 years old, with 12 years of working experience, I had the opportunity to live a lot of different lives, working in many different jobs-sectors and experiencing unusual situations for my age.

I am no expert in the topics I write about - **I am a generalist** [(ENTP)](https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality)

I am multi-interested person surrounded by inspiring people.
I work ~~interdisziplinary~~ transdisziplinary and come in contact with related topics and ideas from different perspectives on a regular basis.

Learning is something I deeply enjoy - I invite you to join me on my cognitive adventures.

I am a communicator. I help to communicate and aggregate.
I am a studied Psychologist specialized in communication and interaction – a system thinker and strong enthusiast of Quantum Mechanics. (In my opinion, [[Communication and QM]] have a lot in common.)


If there is anything I am good at, I’d guess its empathy (understanding peoples feelings and motives) and communication (extracting meaning / translating it for others to understand). I am a sensitive person who perceives things that others often don't notice. 

I like to think about the bigger picture.
