##### Now

I currently work at [DataHall](https://datahall.de) as Head of Communication.
We are a [[Holacracy|holocratic]] team of planners with the ambitious vision of building the most innovative datacenter in Europe. 
We are still in stealth mode, a new website and marketing is coming soon!

##### Who I am

![[about me-20240721034345767.jpg|600]]


Although I am "only" 30 years old, with 12 years of working experience, I had the opportunity to live a lot of different lives, working in many different jobs-sectors and experiencing unusual situations for my age.

I am no expert in the topics I write about - **I am a generalist surrounded by inspiring experts**, a jack-of-all-trades and debater [(ENTP)](https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality) [^1]. 
I am multi-interested person, learning is something I deeply enjoy.

I work as an ~~interdisziplinary~~ transdisziplinary communicator – I help to communicate and aggregate.
I am a system thinker.

I am a studied Psychologist specialized in communication and interaction.
If there is anything I am good at, I’d guess its empathy (understanding peoples feelings and motives) and communication (extracting meaning / translating it for others to understand). I am a sensitive person who perceives things that others often don't notice. 

I like to think about the bigger picture – and I invite you to join me on my cognitive adventures.

> **Think outside the box, an remember - there is no box!**

[^1]: I do indeed “have an offbeat, contrarian idea of fun – one that usually involves a healthy dose of spirited debate”, as the 16-personality-test put it words.
