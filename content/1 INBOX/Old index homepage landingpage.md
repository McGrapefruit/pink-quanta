Hi there!

The purpose of this site is to connect with likeminded people and to discuss ==transdisziplinary insights== and [[Syntopy|syntopic concepts]], combining academia, science and art – the concept is still evolving[^1]. 

I am not the sole author of this content. It's a zettelkasten of collective knowledge, curated by me - [[about me|Nikolaus Leonard]].

Pleasure to meet you!

##### This site follows one simple rule
[[spaces|Blue is for reference WHERE &WHAT]], ==PINK is the indicator (HOW/WHY).==

**Before your read further:** **Consider using this site in darkmode**, to fully emerse with the content. (Use the sun/moon icon near the search function)

##### Why make this page?

I'm convinced that [[Communication and QM|communication creates a sur-plus]] and that we can achieve amazing things through sharing our knowledge, and having conversations about the things we are each passionate about.

Feel free to say hi or start a conversation over mastodon / email.
