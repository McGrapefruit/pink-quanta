### Spin


Once a *spin* is determined by measurement, it stays persistent. 

The Instrument which is used for the measurement determines the direction of the spin in relation to its own alignment in space.
If the spin is up, it shows +1,
if the spin points down, the instrument shows -1.

Imagine we measured a particle and the maschine displays +1, so we know that the spin is up. The wave(the superposition) has collapsed, determining the spin of the particle in all measurements that follow.

In this process, the measuring instrument and its relative alignment in space is linked to the measured object and its respective relative position.
If the measuring instrument is turned upside-down, and the measurement is performed with the same +1 determined particle, the detector will measure a -1.
Its like turning the coordinate system upside down, the value flips its sign. 

[In this part of his lecture](https://youtu.be/iJfw6lDlTuA?t=2218) Leonard Susskind explains this phenomenon beautifully. 


The above article contains a summary of his lecture, linked to related concepts.

#### Measurement-Device rotated 90°

If you turn the measuring device on its side (90°), its a whole different story.
