### Photoshooting in an empty Swimmingpool

My Mentor Thomas was a known photographer. He once told me a story, which I have to think of every now and then:  
Their client wanted to do a photoshoot in an empty pool.  
Their assistence went crazy with the task of searching for an empty pool. She called up villas in the area, asking if their pool was empty by any chance or how much it would cost to put all the water out and rent it for a day.  
Thomas knew what to do right away. he just called the local firm who was selling pool-cleaning. He asked them, if they had a client who has not been using their service for the past few weeks. They told him that a specific customer had cancelled their service since their pool was empty atm and arranged a meeting.

When it comes to marketing, I try to think like him. There is always a place that gathers a lot of your potential customers, you just need to find it.
