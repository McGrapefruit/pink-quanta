I studied Psychology for 7 years.
with my mom being a therapist and a family working mostly in medical - I basically grew up with the topic.

I didn't persuite the career of a psychologist/psychotherapeut tho (out of many reasons which are beyond the scope â€“ to be short: My problem is with the 'system', rather than the topic itself.)
But that doesnt mean that I don't think about / deal with psychological questions on a daily basis.	Just in a different setting/environment.
