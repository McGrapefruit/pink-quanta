David LaPoint's theory, known as the "Primer Fields," suggests that electromagnetic fields play a fundamental role in shaping the universe, rather than gravity being the primary force. 

According to LaPoint, magnetic fields and toroidal structures, which he refers to as "Primer Fields," are the building blocks of matter and influence the formation and behavior of celestial bodies, including galaxies, stars, and planets.

In this theory, [[Virtual particles]] — particles that temporarily appear and disappear in quantum fields[^1] — are crucial.

LaPoint argues that these particles, along with the electromagnetic fields, create stable configurations and structures in the cosmos. This challenges the conventional understanding of gravity-dominated cosmic evolution and posits that electromagnetism and plasma physics are more significant than previously thought.

Overall, LaPoint's ideas propose a paradigm shift in understanding the forces and structures that govern the universe, emphasizing the importance of electromagnetic phenomena and virtual particles.
