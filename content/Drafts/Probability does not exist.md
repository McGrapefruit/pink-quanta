##### Probability does not exist

It is a powerful statement, constructed to put a finger on the single most-significant cause of conceptual problems in pre-Bayesian probability theory. **A probability is not a solid object**, like a rock or a tree that the agent might bump into, **but a feeling, an estimate inside himself**.
Previous to Bayesianism, probability was often thought to be a physical property—something objective and having nothing to do with decision-making or agents at all.


If probability is to be a physical property, it had better be a rather ghostly one— one that can be told of in campfire stories, but never quite prodded out of the shadows. Here’s a sample dialogue:

> Pre-Bayesian: Ridiculous, probabilities are without doubt objective. They can be seen in the relative frequencies they cause.
>
> Bayesian: So if p = 0.75 for some event, after 1000 trials we’ll see exactly 750 such events?
>
> Pre-Bayesian: You might, but most likely you won’t see that exactly. You’re just likely to see something close to it.
>
> Bayesian: Likely? Close? How do you define or quantify these things without making reference to your degrees of belief for what will happen?



DEF:

Quantum Bayesianism, as it is called in the literature, usually refers to a point of view on quantum states originally developed by C. M. Caves, C. A. Fuchs, and R. Schack.
