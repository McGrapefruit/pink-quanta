## Why not harness the virtual energy?

Some believe one can borrow energy from virtual particles or virtual energy?

I believe that also, but its like believing in god – how should I know?

There are also a lot of good arguments against that believe.

In the end, if you borrow any measurable quantity of energy, you have to give it back so quickly, nobody (including you) notices that you ever borrowed anything at all.

And if such an energy state existed, that would be really bad news, because it would mean that not only can you take energy from the vacuum, but the vacuum can spontaneously decay into this lower energy state. In other words, the vacuum (hence, our entire universe) would be unstable.
