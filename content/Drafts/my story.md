# My story

## How my journey started

When I quit school to be a professional magician at the age of 17, everybody thought that was a terrible idea. My Dad said he'd threw me out if I were to follow that path. But I couldn't help myself. I *had* to try it. I had to know if it'll work.
I had a great time and loved the curious moments I got to experience â€“ to get a different perspective on how people think and how the mind works.

I spent my time on stage making music (as Gutarist in a Band), playing in Theaters, or performing Magic on the streets. I was know as the guy who performs magic on an ironing board. But thats a story for another time.

Being a magician sparked my interest in the human mind. Therefore I went back to school for my highschool degree, to later be able to study psychology at the LMU in Munich.
To get into university itself was big challenge in itself.

My student years were very hard, I was constantly broke (and I mean VERY broke) and had a lot of bad luck: When I changed University, after studying for 4 semesters, the legislation changed in the same year, forcing the universities to make changes to their curriculums. I was forced to give up all of my ECTS (~65% of the total course) and start from scratch. For that matter I lost all my student-loans, both of them, leaving me without any income and a lot of dept.

More broke than ever, I was advised to pull out of university and give up.

Since all of the student-jobs where not paying enough by the hour to affort a flat in Munich, where I lived and studied, I had to come up with a solution.
I started working as a freelance coach, building websites for clients, coaching unemployed workers for the job center and taking every project I could get my hands on, while studying my Psychology Bachelor full time.
I also did a lot of TV commercials and photo shootings for companies such as PostFinance, Google, Telekom, Lovoo etc.


	I had to move back to my mum to be able to complete my unpaid mandatory internship.
	I also moved away from Munich into a small town in east-germany, to be able to focus on my thesis without having to deal with the enormous rents.

And I made it. I graduated with a thesis in Quantum Mechanics and started working as Head of Communication in a small Startup planning DataCenters soon after.
We have created a new and innovative datacenter-design, competing with the big corporations such as Google, Apple, Amazon & Microsoft.
You can laugh if you want, I dont care - I know it'll work!

And thats where I am at right [[Now]].
