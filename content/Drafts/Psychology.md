![[Psychology-20240706225644828.png|600]]




**Special topics that spark my interest**
- Interpersonal differences between our perception of "reality" (and the philosophical question of what reality is)
- How we humans are biased in our perception about everything 
- How we handle emotions





# The Perception of reality
In science, especially in physics, psychology and philosophy, researchers have always been concerned with describing our reality.

Mankind in general has been searching for omni-present & consistent laws to understand and explain the world around them, which implies the thought, that the outside world is (at least to some degree) static and consistent. It is *real*.

But the first question is: What do we mean when we speak about the word 'reality'? Is there a difference between what we perceive *subjectively* and whats happening outside of our mind – and is there even something like an objective reality at all?

What is real? We normally refert to things being real, when we can measure them in some way. For a normal human, this means that we need to see, hear, smell or perceive it in some other sense. Scientists prove realness by coming up with some sort of design, which measures the existence of 'some-thing'.


> „[...] we have to remember, that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning” (Heisenberg, 1989, S. 46).

So, when we introspectively question ourself about our own mind – the measuring device and the object it is measuring are one and the same.
