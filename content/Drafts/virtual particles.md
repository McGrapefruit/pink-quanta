##### Definition of Virtual Particles
> ‘The meaning of quantum fluctuations is that even empty space-time is filled with virtual particle pairs. These virtual particle pairs emerge from spacetime, then the two charges move a little bit from each other and then again come together. After that they annihilate each other. One partner of the virtual particle pair has positive energy, while the other partner has negative energy.’
> – Professor Stephen Hawking


## Virtual Particles in quantum fluctuations



David LaPoint, in his work on the [[David LaPoint - Primer Fields|Primer Fields]], has developed his own Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) theory.  

## Quantum Foam is a synonym for virtual energy

> ‘One can imagine the vacuum as an **energy reservoir** – virtual particles are those that emerge from the vacuum and momentarily borrow some of its energy. Their existence is fleeting, and they disappear again into the vacuum taking the borrowed energy with them. Maybe this energy returns to its source or maybe it is transferred to particles at a different place [...] Hence virtual particles function as transmitters which influence the interaction of more durable, stable particles.’
> – Professor Lisa Randall
