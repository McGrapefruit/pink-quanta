## quantum fluctuations

> ‘The meaning of quantum fluctuations is that even empty space-time is filled with virtual particle pairs. These virtual particle pairs emerge from spacetime, then the two charges move a little bit from each other and then again come together. After that they annihilate each other. One partner of the virtual particle pair has positive energy, while the other partner has negative energy.’
