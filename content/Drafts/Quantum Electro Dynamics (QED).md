> The quantum electrodynamics theory (QED) was developed in the middle of
> the 20th century and it describes for the first time the physical mechanism of
> how the electromagnetic and weak interaction works. In QED a so-called virtual
> particle transfers and creates the electromagnetic interaction. ([[Marcus Reid| Reid]], 2024)



> [[Virtual particles]] seem to be fixed to a ‘frame’.





> According to quantum field theories, space-time is not empty but is completely
> filled with so-called virtual particles, which just emerge into existence from
> ‘nothing’ and shortly after disappearing again back into nothing. The concept
> behind the quantum field theories is, that all forces and energies are created
> from the interaction between virtual- and observable particles. Even matter itself
> receives its mass through an interaction with virtual particles (Higgs Boson).
