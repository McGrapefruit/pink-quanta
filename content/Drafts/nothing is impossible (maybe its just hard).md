## Nothing is impossible (maybe its just hard)

	The ability to djuge if something is impossible 


	Magic works because people tend to not condider logical possibilities to explain the effect simply because the deem the underlying mechanism of the effect impossible, when it is in reality just insainly hard or complex.

When there is something that I have learned:

> Nothing is Impossible, even the word itself says "I'm possible"

Throughout my life I have done a lot of things I was told I wouldn't be capable of.

- My teachers told me I was a lost cause, that I would never be successful. I just wasn't interested in what they had to offer me.
- When I quit school to be a professional magician, I was laughed at.
- When I go back to school to get my highschool degree (Abitur) a view years later, everyone was very sceptical
- When I told them I wanted to study psychology (which requires only the best grades), they laughed at me
- When I set the goal to be a manager with power of decision without taking the long corporate ladder, they told me I was naive

Nontheless, I have achieved what I envisioned for myself.

Now I wanna share my story and I have learned on the way.
