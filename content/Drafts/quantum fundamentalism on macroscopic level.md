If everything is made out of quants, that means that on a very fundamentalistic level, [[quantum-mechanics|Quantum Mechanics]] *could* also describe some aspects happening on a macroscopic level – or it rather doesn‘t describe it. It just behaves weird.

Every science-form could potentially shows quantum behaviour of some sort (to some extent).
For example, the principles of *non-linear,* *discrete energy jumps* (or principles "critical mass"[^3] as some people name it) can be found in biological processes.


In the human body, certain processes initiated by bacteria only commence once a sufficient number of bacteria are present. If the number falls below this threshold, the remaining bacteria, despite being fully functional, remain inactive. This is a clear example of non-linear biological processes.
Similarly, the relationship between sperm count and fertility is *non-linear*. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), men with a sperm concentration below 15 million per milliliter are considered infertile. Studies show that as sperm concentration increases beyond this threshold, a man's fertility improves significantly, and his partner is more likely to conceive quickly during intercourse (Spermienzahl, ZEIT Online, 2023).
