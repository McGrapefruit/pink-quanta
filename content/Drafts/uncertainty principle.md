##### Heisenberg's uncertainty principle

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle can be understood as a fundamental rule or axiom
of quantum mechanics. It tells us, that we can not have certainty over all qualities of a particle at the same time and therefore contradicts *General relativity*.

In broad terms: We either know where a particle is (position), or we know how fast and in which direction it is moving (momentum). We can not know both. Measuring on of the qualities impacts and changes the other.

**if we know everything about the location of a particle (the uncertainty of position is small), we know nothing about its momentum (the uncertainty of momentum is large), and vice versa**.

i.e. Detectors in the double-slit experiment often work with lasers (photons) to measure which slit the particle went through. If the laser hits the particle, you know the particle is there (location), but you have altered the momentum/direction of the particle by hitting it with said laser, altering its momentum.
