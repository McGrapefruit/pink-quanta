## who I am 
Hi, my Name is Nikolaus Leonard, a 30 years old dude from Germany.
Although I have "only" 12 years of working experience, I had the opportunity to live a lot of different lives, work in many different jobs-sectors and experience a lot of unusual situations for my age.

I am no expert in the topics I write about - **I am a generalist**  [(ENTP)](https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality)

I am multi interested person surrounded by inspiring people. 
I work ~~interdisziplinary~~ transdisziplinary and often come in contact with the same topics and ideas from different perspectives.

Learning is something I deeply enjoy - I invite you to join me on my cognitive adventures.

I am a communicator. I help to communicate and aggregate.
I am a studied Psychologist specialized in communication and interaction – a system thinker and strong enthusiast of Quantum Mechanics. (In my opinion, [[Communication and QM]] have a lot in common.)

If there is anything I am *really* good at, I guess its empathy (perceiving things and understanding peoples feelings and motives) and communication (extracting meaning / translating it for others to understand).

I am a META-Thinker, I get the bigger picture.

## nothing is impossible (maybe its just hard)

	The ability to djuge if something is impossible 


	Magic works because people tend to not condider logical possibilities to explain the effect simply because the deem the underlying mechanism of the effect impossible, when it is in reality just insainly hard or complex.

When there is something that I have learned:

>  Nothing is Impossible, even the word itself says "I'm possible"

Throughout my life I have done a lot of things I was told I wouldn't be capable of.

- My teachers told me I was a lost cause, that I would never be successful. I just wasn't interested in what they had to offer me.
- When I quit school to be a professional magician, I was laughed at.
- When I go back to school to get my highschool degree (Abitur) a view years later, everyone was very sceptical 
- When I told them I wanted to study psychology (which requires only the best grades), they laughed at me
- When I set the goal to be a manager with power of decision without taking the long corporate ladder, they told me I was naive

Nontheless, I have achieved what I envisioned for myself.

Now I wanna share my story and I have learned on the way.

## how my journey started
When I quit school to be a professional magician at the age of 17, everybody thought that was a terrible idea. My Dad said he'd threw me out if I were to follow that path. But I couldn't help myself. I *had* to try it. I had to know if it'll work.
I had a great time and loved the curious moments I got to experience – to get a different perspective on how people think and how the mind works.

I spent my time on stage making music (as Gutarist in a Band), playing in Theaters, or performing Magic on the streets. I was know as the guy who performs magic on an ironing board. But thats a story for another time.

Being a magician sparked my interest in the human mind. Therefore I went back to school for my highschool degree, to later be able to study psychology at the LMU in Munich.
To get into university itself was big challenge in itself. 

My student years were very hard, I was constantly broke (and I mean VERY broke) and had a lot of bad luck: When I changed University, after studying for 4 semesters, the legislation changed in the same year, forcing the universities to make changes to their curriculums. I was forced to give up all of my ECTS (~65% of the total course) and start from scratch. For that matter I lost all my student-loans, both of them, leaving me without any income and a lot of dept.

More broke than ever, I was advised to pull out of university and give up.

Since all of the student-jobs where not paying enough by the hour to affort a flat in Munich, where I lived and studied, I had to come up with a solution.
I started working as a freelance coach, building websites for clients, coaching unemployed workers for the job center and taking every project I could get my hands on, while studying my Psychology Bachelor full time.
I also did a lot of TV commercials and photo shootings for companies such as PostFinance, Google, Telekom, Lovoo etc.


	I had to move back to my mum to be able to complete my unpaid mandatory internship.
	I also moved away from Munich into a small town in east-germany, to be able to focus on my thesis without having to deal with the enormous rents.

And I made it. I graduated with a thesis in Quantum Mechanics and started working as Head of Communication in a small Startup planning DataCenters soon after. 
We have created a new and innovative datacenter-design, competing with the big corporations such as Google, Apple, Amazon & Microsoft. 
You can laugh if you want, I dont care - I know it'll work!

And thats where I am at right [[Now]].
