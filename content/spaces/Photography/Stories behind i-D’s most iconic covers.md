**The Head to Toe Issue, No. 8, October 1982**
"Scarlett O'Horror was working as a hairdresser at Antenna on Kensington Church Street. She was also well known on the London nightlife scene at the time. I photographed her in various looks in the 80s and did a short horror movie and music video with her. When she came to visit me in Munich in 1980, she and her style caused crowds to gather and stare. 25 years on and I met her in London in 2007. Now she is Scarlett the heavenly healer."
