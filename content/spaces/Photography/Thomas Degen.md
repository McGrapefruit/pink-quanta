## About


In 1962, at the age of seven, he received his first camera – a DIANA camera capable of holding 16 images in a 4x4 cm format.

His passion for photography truly sparked, however, during his first airplane ride in 1969. During the flight, he ended up using almost all of the 72 shots he had brought for the entire trip, captivated by cloud formations and intriguing details of the airplane. By the time the plane landed, he had made up his mind: he would pursue a career as either a pilot or a photographer.

Thomas Degen (THD) had a keen eye for the ordinary and the overlooked, capturing such subjects in a way that cast them in a new light. He was driven by a quest to find his internal visions within the external world.

> "We only see a tiny fraction of reality."


From 1980 to 2007, Thomas Degen (THD) worked for prestigious publications such as Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, and i-D magazine.

His works have been showcased in renowned institutions like the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, Le Musée Des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and the Chelsea Art Museum in New York.
