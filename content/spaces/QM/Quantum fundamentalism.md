So, how does the world seem to be structured?

In a quantum world, which is abiding to the laws of quantum mechanics, Energy levels do not shift linearly but rather in discrete steps. This is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics which.

> ==To each change in nature corresponds an integer number of quanta== of action. Action variables may only change by integer values of h, requiring all other physical quantities to change by discrete steps, “quantum jumps”. (Capellmann, 2021, S. 1)


If everything is made out of quants, that means that on a very fundamentalistic level, [[spaces/quantum-mechanics|Quantum Mechanics]] *could* also describe some aspects happening on a macroscopic level – or it rather doesn‘t describe it. It just behaves weird.

Every science-form could potentially shows quantum behaviour of some sort (to some extent). 
For example, the principles of *non-linear,*  *discrete energy jumps*  (or principles "critical mass"[^3] as some people name it) can be found in biological processes.


In the human body, certain processes initiated by bacteria only commence once a sufficient number of bacteria are present. If the number falls below this threshold, the remaining bacteria, despite being fully functional, remain inactive. This is a clear example of non-linear biological processes. 
Similarly, the relationship between sperm count and fertility is *non-linear*. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), men with a sperm concentration below 15 million per milliliter are considered infertile. Studies show that as sperm concentration increases beyond this threshold, a man's fertility improves significantly, and his partner is more likely to conceive quickly during intercourse (Spermienzahl, ZEIT Online, 2023).

[^3]: Its like the analogy: "1 man can't build 1 house, but 20 men can built 20 houses."
[^4]: "For instance, according to the wave function description every quantum system may be in a superposition of different states because a combination of state vectors is also a state vector. Now, assuming that both the quantum object and the measuring apparatus are quantum systems that each can be described by a wave function, it follows that their entangled state would likewise be represented by a state vector."
