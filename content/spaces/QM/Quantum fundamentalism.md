> Apparently, we are living in a quantum world since everything is constituted by atomic and subatomic particles. Hence **classical physics seems merely to be a useful approximation to a world which is quantum mechanical on all scales.** [^1]


If everything is made out of quanta, that means that on a very fundamentalistic level, [[spaces/quantum-mechanics|Quantum Mechanics]] *could* also describe some aspects of the world happening on a macroscopic level - or rather *doesnt* describe it. It just behaves weird.

For example, the principle of critical mass and discrete energy jumps in some QM theories can be seen in biological processes. In our gut, there are specific bacteria that only begin their activity once they have reached a certain critical mass. Imagine needing 100 percent of these bacteria to perform a function - if you remove 2 percent, leaving 98 percent of the bacteria, they do not perform 98 percent of the work but rather 0 percent. The bacteria become active only when they reach their full complement: 100 percent, at which point they take over 100 percent of the work. The energy level does not increase linearly but in jumps.


> The basic assumption behind quantum fundamentalism is that the structure of the formalism, in this case the wave function, corresponds to how the world is structured. For instance, according to the wave function description every quantum system may be in a superposition of different states because a combination of state vectors is also a state vector. Now, ==assuming that both the quantum object and the measuring apparatus are quantum systems== that each can be described by a wave function, ==it follows that their entangled state would likewise be represented by a state vector==[^2]
