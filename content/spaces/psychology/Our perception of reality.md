In science, especially in physics, psychology and philosophy, researchers have always been concerned with describing our reality.

Mankind in general has been searching for omni-present & consistent laws to understand and explain the world around them, which implies the thought, that the outside world is (at least to some degree) static and consistent. It is *real*.

But the first question is: 

###### What do we mean when we speak about the word 'reality'? 
Is there a difference between what we perceive *subjectively* and whats happening outside of our mind – and is there even something like an objective reality at all?

What does *real* even mean?
We normally refert to things being real, when we can measure them in some way. For a normal human, this means that we need to see, hear, smell or perceive it in some other sense.
Scientists prove realness by coming up with some sort of design (operationalisation), to measure the existence of 'some-thing' and its characteristics.

> „[...] we have to remember, that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning” (Heisenberg, 1989, S. 46).

##### objective and subjective 

> These uncertainties may be called objective in so far as they are simply a consequence of the description in terms of classical physics and do not depend on any observer. 
> They may be called subjective in so far as they refer to our incomplete knowledge of the world. (Heisenberg et al. (1958)


In classical physics objective reality is considered local and real (*local-realism*). [[quantum-mechanics (QM)|Quantum Mechanics]] changed our wordview in that matter, showing that measuring something can actually change reality, and that reality is not just objective and static – not everything is pre-determined!
Even Einstein didnt like that thought at the time, that the universe could be indeterministic and wrote the famous EPR_Paper. Read more about [[The most common arguments against QM]].

A [[Quantum fundamentalism|Quantum Fundamentalists]] might say, that the measuring instrument (MI) and the measured object (MO), is entangled and could itself be represented by a state vector.


So, when we introspectively question ourself about our own mind – the measuring device (our mind) and the object it is measuring (our mind) are one and the same. 
How can we find reliable trues about ourself?
