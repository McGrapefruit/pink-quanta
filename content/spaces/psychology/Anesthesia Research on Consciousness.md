description: Research has shown that the state of unconsciousness induced by controlled intoxication with anesthetics is triggered by a reduction in the vibration frequency of microtubules, which normally occurs in the terahertz range. These findings imply that quantum vibrations within microtubules may play a crucial role in the development of human consciousness.

Studies conducted by the University of Arizona have demonstrated that the onset of unconsciousness due to anesthesia is associated with alterations in quantum vibrations within microtubules. In a conscious state, microtubules exhibit high-frequency quantum vibrations in the terahertz range (between 480 and 700 THz). 

The administration of anesthetics specifically disrupts or inhibits these tubulin oscillations. This suggests that these quantum vibrations may play a central role in the emergence of human consciousness. [^1] [^2]

Conversely, other substances, such as the psychoactive compound psilocybin, can increase the frequency of these quantum vibrations.
