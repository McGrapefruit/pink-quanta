[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) became my weapon of choice against the chaos in my life.
In this blog I want to share my experience using Obsidian for every aspect of my life in the past 3 years.

##### What is Obsidian

Obsidian is a note app which can be configured and used in a million different ways, from simplistic note-taking to advanced *Information-Management-Systems*. 

##### why use Obsidian?
There are a lot of reasons of [[Why I use Obsidian|why I use Obsidian]] instead of any other software. 
**Data-sovereignty** (offline data, no vendor lock-in, human readable markdown files which can be imported into every other tool), as well as the **freedom to build any workflow** you come up with, are only a few of the reasons.

##### WHo is Obsidian for
==Obsidian is for everybody who writes notes about "stuff" and wants to keep and easily find those notes again in the future (future-proof).==


It's great for students/university/education, (project-) managers, assistants, side-husslers, hobbies, (journal-)writers etc. – anything that has to do with organisation or writing. If you are already using tools like Evernote, Apple-notes, onenote or similar, you will LOVE Obsidian.

### What I use Obsidian for
I use Obsidian to track, document and plan everything I am interested in and want to focus on. Everything, from my work to my personal interests, is neatly organised in one vault.

###### I manage my professional ==work==  

- `task management` 
- `projectmanagement` 
- nearly all business `documentation` of our startup-company
- Marketing
	- whitepaper planning
	- company Info
	- Blogposts

###### But I also use it to organize my ==private== life: 
- `Journal` Notes
- interests & hobbies 
	- `books` I read
	- things I `learn` 
	- `photography` and `art` 
	- `psychology` and QM
- `freelance projects` & `side hussle`,
- `burocracy`
