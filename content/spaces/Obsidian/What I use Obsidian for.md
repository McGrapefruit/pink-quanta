I use Obsidian to track, document and plan everything I am interested in and want to focus on. Everything, from my work to my personal interests, is neatly organised in one vault.

###### I manage my professional ==work==

- `task management`
- `projectmanagement`
- nearly all business `documentation` of our startup-company
- Marketing
	- whitepaper planning
	- company Info
	- Blogposts

###### But I also use it to organize my ==private== life:

- `Journal` Notes
- interests & hobbies
	- `books` I read
	- things I `learn`
	- `photography` and `art`
	- `psychology` and QM
- `freelance projects` & `side hustle`,
- `burocracy`
