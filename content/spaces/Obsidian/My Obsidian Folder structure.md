title: How I structure my notes & Folders in Obsidian
tags: Obsidian
related-to:
  - "[[My Obsidian System]]"
---





 The folders associated with my professional work are separated from the Knowledge-Vault, while my Personal Stuff is also separately stored from everything else.
 
 I could send a colleague a folder containing all the notes from a certain project without having to search or sort them beforehand without having to fear to accidentally reveal something private.
 
 The subfolders of my Workfolder `4 Work` are encoded in [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/), starting with a new 3-letter identifyer (i.e. DTH-AC.ID).
 This Enables me to add a new layer to the structure and use "different systems within the system".
 
  If I want to open folder in the general root-folderstructure of the vault, I simply search for the corresponding JD.AC. If the folder I am searching is related to our company, I use the same JD.AC. I just add the name of the company (3 letter identifyer).
