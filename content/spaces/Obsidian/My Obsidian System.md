## My [[obsidian]] Workflow

My system combines my experiences from different companies and their data structures as well as inspirations from different systems/frameworks.

In my opinion, **a good system should address and mimic how the human brain is designed:**
We perceive only a fraction of the information we are confronted with by the outside world â€“ the brain filters out 95% of the noise, only making us conscious of relevant stimuli.

**A digital system** / Life OS, which is used to manage all kind of projects **produces a lot of content, which turns to noise if it is not carefully filtered and structured**.
At all times it should only provide you with relevant information while also resurfacing old notes, making thoughts salient again, enabeling new connections though meta-cognition.

When I build my obsidian-setup, I did not only focus on the system itself - how the data & information is organized, but also how it is presented/displayed. Therefore I tried to utilize psychological concepts while designing my [[Pink Quanta Theme]].

### How my vault is structured

My Vault is structured based on the following concepts, which I changed and scrambled together to fit my needs: 

- [PARA-Method](https://mattgiaro.com/para-obsidian/)
- [Pillars, Pipelines & Vaults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d93SGaf82OM) for Notion by [August Breadly](https://www.yearzero.io/notion-life-design)
- [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) for structuring folders 
- A [Hot-cool Inbox](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Inbox) inspired by LYT 


My workflow has a Top-down process and is compairable to the graphic from [David Allen](davidco.com).

The vault itself is structured via tags **and** folders, since I wanna future proof my system as much as possible. In case Obsidian would stop working, I would a nicely sorted folderstructure, instead of just a few chaotic folders containing hundreds of zettels.

I use the plugin `Auto note mover`, which moves the files into the correct locations, depending on the tag. That way I get the best of both worlds.


The structure of my folders is inspired by the [PARA-](https://mattgiaro.com/para-obsidian/) and the "[PPV](https://www.yearzero.io/notion-life-design)"- Method adjusted to my needs, only just using the bits, which were helpful to me.
I came up with a different terminology, which feels more intuitive to me.

I also came up with my own Terminology for sorting my notes in obsidian.
