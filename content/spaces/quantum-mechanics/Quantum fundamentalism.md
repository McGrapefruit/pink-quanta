*Quantum Fundamentalism* refers to the view that quantum mechanics provides the most fundamental description of physical phenomena.

> "Apparently, we are living in a quantum world since everything is constituted by atomic and subatomic particles. Hence ==classical physics seems merely to be a useful approximation to a world which is quantum mechanical on all scales==." (Zinkernagel, 2015)

>"**The basic assumption behind quantum fundamentalism is that** the structure of the formalism, in this case **the wave function**, **corresponds to how the world is structured**".[^4]

So, how does the world seem to be structured?

In a quantum world, which is abiding to the laws of quantum mechanics, Energy levels do not shift linearly but rather in discrete steps. This is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics.

> ==To each change in nature corresponds an integer number of quanta== of action. Action variables may only change by integer values of $h$[^5], requiring all other physical quantities to change by discrete steps, “quantum jumps”.
