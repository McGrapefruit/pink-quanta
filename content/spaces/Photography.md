My later Mentor [[Thomas Degen|Thomas Degen]], who was a known fashion photographer, sparked my love for *painting with light*.
He only made his money with fashion, but in his heart he was a true artist. Sadly only a small fraction of his works has ever been on display. Especially his late works have never seen the light outside of his studio-basement.

Thomas experienced extraordinary adventures in the 70ies-80ies, most of his stories took place in a world which doesn't exist anymore â€“ Experiences which are no longer possible today. Talking to him was like a history lesson. In fact I learned everything I know about history from him.

Some of the stories I share on this site are in honour of Thomas, as he is sadly no longer able to tell them himself.
We even startet building an Art Agency together, called [[KALEIDOS]] which is not active at the moment due to his death. I inherited his whole archive containing 10s of thousands of dias, negatives and prints, which I will gradually curate, digitize and exhibit.
