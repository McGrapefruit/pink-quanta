### Obsidian & Digital Knowledge- and Projektmanagement

I am a [[obsidian_md]] fanboy, there is no denying it.

Obsidian is a software which helps you to store and connect notes and thoughts in a super simple way. In my opinion the obsidian online-community paints a picture of an overly complicated software, which is aimed at hardcore academics, PKM-Nerds, computer scientists or for Pen&Paper-Games. But thats not true at all.

==Obsidian is great for== students/university/**Education**, (Project) **Managers**, **Assistants**, Side-Husslers, **Hobbies**, (Journal-)**Writers** etc. â€“ ==anything that has to do with organisation or writing.==

Read about [[Why I use Obsidian]] or  [[How to get started with Obsidian|how to get started with Obsidian]] without a headache. Feel free to reach out if you feel stuck.

If you are already using obsidian and have everything figured out and are searching for inspiration, you may be interested in [[My Obsidian System|how my Obsidian Knowledge- and Projektmanagement-System is designed]], which I tailored to my unconventional needs & different purposes.
