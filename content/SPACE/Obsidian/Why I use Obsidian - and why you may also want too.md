**How Obsidian became my weapon of choice against the chaos in my life.**

Why tho?

For many years, I worked on different methods to structure Information for different usecases within different systems/softwares and collaborative situations. By myself or within a team.

I used to take a lot of notes: Evernote, MS Word docs, MS Onenote, iCloud Notes, handwritten moleskines and notepads – you name it.
At least 10 pieces of paper were flying all over my desk at all times, containing different information, small notes & scribbles.

I found myself having multiple notebooks for different purposes - a process that was effective but also incredibly time-consuming and often frustrating. It worked, but it always drove me nuts, since i knew where the information was to be found, but was not always available to me right away. Combining different notes together was a physical act of rewriting stuff into another more general Notebook (compairable to a MOC)

In 2018 I switched to a single [BulletJournal](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq) (analog moleskine book), which I used on a daily basis to structure work and private tasks, goals, events, Idea collections & so on.  
I created tons and tons of notes within different media between different devices.

As a IT-Project Manager I (was forced to) use:

- Podio (cetrix)
- MS Teams
- Notion
- Monday.com
- File-sharing word documents within buggy cloud-enviroments (disgusting!)
    - Dropbox
    - Nextcloud
    - GoogleDocs

I tried out nearly all PKM software on the market, till I found obsidian in 2021 and I never looked back.

Here is why: If you ever switched a software/framework, or system within a company, you know why. Because everything is vendor-locked-in. Not just the notes, the structure of your notes, the system you built. Everything.

Also most of the plattforms save your data in the cloud, so you need an internet connection to access them.
We had the experience of the Podio-servers being down for 4 business days. We could do nothing. We had no contact information of our customers, no infos about projects, deadlines, calender infos. NOTHING.


Have you ever used Notion with a slow internet connection? It feels like being stuck in the early 2000s on your moms computer. Wanna access that one text file while you are in a train in Germany? Good luck!


All these problems vanished with obisidian.
In Obsidian everything is offline, saved as .md-filed within a folder on your Desktop.
Sure its not made for collaboration of teams (thats why we also have a notion account for our teams).

But I tend to be the most organized member of the team - and I find everything I saved within seconds. I write everything local and If I need to share my notes, I just copy/paste the markdown into Notion and everything is formatted nicely, takes 2 seconds.

What I dont like in notion is, that you still need to put everything in a box. In which Meeting did we talk about those 3 projects? 
If I need info about 1 project, I need to search in the vaste meeting-notes folder.
Was it 4 or 5 weeks ago? Did the discussion happen in a JourFixe Call or some other short meeting? Where should I start my search?
In obsidian I just click on the project and have every meeting, every info about the project that is being talked about at hand – in seconds. I can cross search the meeting notes with the tags of the 3 projects and voila, there is the needed protocol right away.

I have the option to make a quick fulltext search through all documents saved within my vault: Documents, Meeting notes, daily work logs, journals, sources like article or books, etc. 
If I have written (or copy pasted) it, I can find it.

If i only remember a small detail about it (a distinct sentence / keyword, some metadata, a hashtag or even some related topic), I find it almost instantly.
There is no friction writing thoughts down in my obsidian. The underlying system I built helps me to find and therefore retain the notes at all times and resurfaces them I unexpected yet suitable areas and encurage creative connections.

It gives thoughts and creativity a space to evolve, while at the same time also documenting the status quo as well as the results of it.
