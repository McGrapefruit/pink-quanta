## My Obsidian Workflow

My system combines my experiences from different companies and their data structures as well as inspirations from different systems/frameworks.

In my opinion, **a good system should address and mimic how the human brain is designed:**
We perceive only a fraction of the information we are confronted with by the outside world â€“ the brain filters out 95% of the noise, only making us conscious of relevant stimuli.

A digital system / Life OS, which is used to manage all kind of projects produces a lot of content, which turns to noise if it is not carefully filtered and structured.
At all times it should only provide you with relevant information while also resurfacing old notes, making thoughts salient again, enabeling new connections though meta-cognition.

My Vault is structured based on the following concepts, which I changed and scrambled together to fit my needs: 

- [PARA-Method](https://mattgiaro.com/para-obsidian/)
- [Pillars, Pipelines & Vaults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d93SGaf82OM) for Notion by [August Breadly](https://www.yearzero.io/notion-life-design)
- [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) for structuring folders 
- A [Hot-cool Inbox](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Inbox) inspired by LYT 


My workflow has a Top-down process and is compairable to the graphic from [David Allen](davidco.com).

The vault itself is structured via tags **and** folders, since I wanna future proof my system as much as possible. In case Obsidian would stop working, I would a nicely sorted folderstructure, instead of just a few chaotic folders containing hundreds of zettels.

I use the plugin `Auto note mover`, which moves the files into the correct locations, depending on the tag. That way I get the best of both worlds.


The structure of my folders is inspired by the [PARA-](https://mattgiaro.com/para-obsidian/) and the "[PPV](https://www.yearzero.io/notion-life-design)"- Method adjusted to my needs, only just using the bits, which were helpful to me.
I came up with a different terminology, which feels more intuitive to me.

> [!info]- My folderstructure
>  The folders associated with my professional work are seperated from the Knowledge-Vault, while my Personal Stuff is also seperately stored from everything else . I could send a colleague a folder containing all the notes from a certain project without having to search for them nor having to fear to accidently reveal something private.
>  
>  The subfolders of my Workfolder `4 Work` are encoded in [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/)
>  This Enables me to add a new layer to the structure  and use  "different systems within the system".
