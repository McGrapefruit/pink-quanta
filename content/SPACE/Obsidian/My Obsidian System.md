## Preamble
> [!warning] Warning: The Dangers of Obsidian
> Obsidian can be highly addictive, functions as a vast rabbithole and can be a massivly effective procrastination tool, since everything you build to be more organized feels so productive. I know what I am talking about :-)
> If you start using Obsidian and are new to the topic, start with learning about the [Pareto-principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
> 
> Also this is just a joke. **Have fun and enjoy the ride!** And if you get stuck, dont waste hours of your time figuring something out, which somebody else might already has accomplished. Visit the obsidian Forum and talk to some people instead! (Don't be a stubborn perfectionist like me)


In the past 2.5 years I spent a lot of time fiddeling with my obsidian vault.
I have spent hundreds of hours trying out different workflows, restructured my setup countless times and even developed my own system and color-theme.

It took some time to combine my experience from the many PMS I used in the past, but ==it was worth the effort==.

That I 'wasted' so much time configuring my obsidian does not mean that it is complicated, nor does it have to be. It just that I had something very specific in mind and my needs are somewhat unusual.
**You can start using obsidian, have it configured and be familiar with it within a weekend,** if you are motivated.

I read a lot about people struggling with the variety of the offered options and different solutions on how to structure a vault. But I think thats the beauty of it, that there are so many individual ways to build a system that fits their needs and their thinking/work process.

> [!Tip] My Tipp 
> My tipp for people who wanna start using Obsidian is to get inspired by others to a certain point, but to always stick to your own thing and to **never adopt something, just because it works for somebody else** or looks good. Build the system AROUND your workflow, dont try to come up with a system which you would need to adapt to. The system should work for you - not the other way around. Let it grow organically. Only adapt it to new situations, when a new need arises.

When I build my obsidian, I did not only focus on the system itself - how the data & information is organized, but also how it is presented/displayed.

I tried to use psychological concepts while designing my [[Pink Quanta Theme|Pink Quanta Theme]]:
How do we know something is important? Through contrast.
Our brain is programmed to focus on stimuli which stand out.

## My Obsidian Workflow
My system combines my experiences from different companies and their data structures as well as inspirations from different systems/frameworks.

My Vault is structured based on the following concepts, which I changed to fit my needs: 

- [PARA-Method](https://mattgiaro.com/para-obsidian/)
- [Pillars, Pipelines & Vaults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d93SGaf82OM) for Notion by [August Breadly](https://www.yearzero.io/notion-life-design)
- [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) for structuring folders 
- A [Hot-cool Inbox](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Inbox) inspired by LYT 


My workflow has a Top-down process and is compairable to the graphic from [David Allen](davidco.com).

The vault itself is structured via tags **and** folders, since I wanna future proof my system as much as possible. In case Obsidian would stop working, I would a nicely sorted folderstructure, instead of just a few chaotic folders containing hundreds of zettels.

I use the plugin `Auto note mover`, which moves the files into the correct locations, depending on the tag. That way I get the best of both worlds.


The structure of my folders is inspired by the [PARA-](https://mattgiaro.com/para-obsidian/) and the "[PPV](https://www.yearzero.io/notion-life-design)"- Method (I mixed them to my linking and needs, just using the bits, which were helpful to me.
I came up with a different terminology, which feels more intuitive to me.
