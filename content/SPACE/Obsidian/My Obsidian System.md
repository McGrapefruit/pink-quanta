## Preamble
> [!warning] Warning: The Dangers of Obsidian
> Obsidian can be highly addictive, functions as a vast rabbithole and can be a massivly effective procrastination tool, since everything you build to be more organized feels so productive. I know what I am talking about :-)
> If you start using Obsidian and are new to the topic, start with learning about the [Pareto-principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
> 
> Also this is just a joke. **Have fun and enjoy the ride!** And if you get stuck, dont waste hours of your time figuring something out, which somebody else might already has accomplished. Visit the obsidian Forum and talk to some people instead! (Don't be a stubborn perfectionist like me)


In the past 2.5 years I spent a lot of time fiddeling with my obsidian vault.
I have spent hundreds of hours trying out different workflows, restructured my setup countless times and even developed my own system and color-theme.

It took some time to combine my experience from the many PMS I used in the past, but ==it was worth the effort==.

That I 'wasted' so much time configuring my obsidian does not mean that it is complicated, nor does it have to be. It just that I had something very specific in mind and my needs are somewhat unusual.
**You can start using obsidian, have it configured and be familiar with it within a weekend,** if you are motivated.

I read a lot about people struggling with the variety of the offered options and different solutions on how to structure a vault. But I think thats the beauty of it, that there are so many individual ways to build a system that fits their needs and their thinking/work process.

> [!Tip] My Tipp 
> My tipp for people who wanna start using Obsidian is to get inspired by others to a certain point, but to always stick to your own thing and to **never adopt something, just because it works for somebody else** or looks good. Build the system AROUND your workflow, dont try to come up with a system which you would need to adapt to. The system should work for you - not the other way around. Let it grow organically. Only adapt it to new situations, when a new need arises.

When I build my obsidian, I did not only focus on the system itself - how the data & information is organized, but also how it is presented/displayed.

I tried to use psychological concepts while designing my [[Pink Quanta Theme|Pink Quanta Theme]]:
How do we know something is important? Through contrast.
Our brain is programmed to focus on stimuli which stand out.

## My Obsidian Workflow
My system combines my experiences from different companies and their data structures as well as inspirations from different systems/frameworks.

My Vault is structured based on the following concepts, which I changed to fit my needs: 

- [PARA-Method](https://mattgiaro.com/para-obsidian/)
- [Pillars, Pipelines & Vaults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d93SGaf82OM) for Notion by [August Breadly](https://www.yearzero.io/notion-life-design)
- [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) for structuring folders 
- A [Hot-cool Inbox](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Inbox) inspired by LYT 


My workflow has a Top-down process and is compairable to the graphic from [David Allen](davidco.com).

The vault itself is structured via tags **and** folders, since I wanna future proof my system as much as possible. In case Obsidian would stop working, I would a nicely sorted folderstructure, instead of just a few chaotic folders containing hundreds of zettels.

I use the plugin `Auto note mover`, which moves the files into the correct locations, depending on the tag. That way I get the best of both worlds.


The structure of my folders is inspired by the [PARA-](https://mattgiaro.com/para-obsidian/) and the "[PPV](https://www.yearzero.io/notion-life-design)"- Method (I mixed them to my linking and needs, just using the bits, which were helpful to me.
I came up with a different terminology, which feels more intuitive to me.


## My Obsidian Terminology

Some people are calling their new notes "seedlings", while elaborated ones are called "Evergreen".
I wanted something which suits my passion, so I named and built my system on the analogy of physical particles.

Everything starts with a **QUANTUM**, which is a fluctuating thought I wrote down. Either they get liked to other notes, grow and persist, or they die - like a seedling.
My inbox is structured similar to the [Hot-cool Inbox](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Inbox) from the LYT-framework. That way I keep track of older Quanta and can decide how to proceed with these notes.

Since the obsidian community calls their small Notes "Atomic notes" and the Index notes MOCs (Map of Content) I wanted to stick with this methodology, so that people can relate to it more easily.

### Types of notes / content

So, a small note is called an **ATOM**, many ATOMS linked together form a **MOC** (Molecule) and many molecules together form **SPACE**.

The only thing I added, was a DOC, which has a different purpose than all the other type of notes.


| TYPE | Description | Examples |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ==SPACE== | **Area**  / Topic<br>Can be categorized into physical boxes or happens within a defined environment. Spaces are Dashboards, which add a new layer in order to structure related Mocs. Every space has its own Hashtag and is automatically sorted into the accompanying folder. | Work, Side Hussle, Personal Areas |
| ==MOC== | **Molecule** - Structure of linked DOCs, ATOMs and QUANTAs.<br>Its an INDEX note aka. a "Map Of Content" | Projects, Concepts, Constructs |
| ==DOC== | **Documents** with a definied purpose and structure. Important stuff which need safe keeping<br>Documentations, bureaucracy related stuff etc. | Bureaucracy Docs, Documentation, Formal Letters |
| ==ATOM== | **Atoms** <br>Smallest unit of information that has value on its own (self-contained, isolated Knowledge ) | Wiki-Notes,<br>Article, Tutorial |
| ==QUANTA== | **Virtual particles**<br>Small fluctuating Information (zettels) with unclear goal; thinking on paper. Ideas which spontaneously emerge behave like fragile synapses searching new connections. Such neural networks are getting annihilated over time if they dont interact with another "System", strengthening the synapses. If its is not being linked / incorporated over time, it will be deleted. | IDEA,  Thinking on Paper, "The idea I had when I drank my coffee - dont know what to do with it yet" |
