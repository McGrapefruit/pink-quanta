## My weapon of choice against the chaos of life


[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) became my weapon of choice against the chaos in my life.
In this SPACE I wanna share my experience using it for every aspect of my life in the past 3 years.

Obsidian is a note app which can be configured and used in a million different ways, from simplistic note-taking to advanced *Information-Management-Systems*. 

I manage my work (as well as nearly all business documentation of our company), and use it to organize my private life: my interests, hobbies, side hussles, art projects, burocracy. All of it.
Everything which I am interested in and want to focus is tracked, documented and planned through Obsidian.

There are a lot of reasons of [[Why I use Obsidian - and why you may also want too| why I use Obsidian ]] instead of any other software. Data-sovereignty (offline, human readable data), and the freedom to build nearly anything are only two of the reasons.

## Preamble

> [!warning] Warning: The Dangers of Obsidian
> Obsidian can be highly addictive, functions as a vast rabbithole and can be a massivly effective procrastination tool, since everything you build to be more organized feels so productive. I know what I am talking about :-)
> If you start using Obsidian and are new to the topic, start with learning about the [Pareto-principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
> 
> Also this is just a joke. **Have fun and enjoy the ride!** And if you get stuck, dont waste hours of your time figuring something out, which somebody else might already has accomplished. Visit the obsidian Forum and talk to some people instead! (Don't be a stubborn perfectionist like me)


I have spent hundreds of hours trying out different workflows, restructured my setup countless times and even developed my own system and color-theme. It took some time to combine my experience from the many PMS I used in the past, but ==it was worth the effort==.
When I build my obsidian-setup, I did not only focus on the system itself - how the data & information is organized, but also how it is presented/displayed.

I tried to use psychological concepts while designing my [[Pink Quanta Theme|Pink Quanta Theme]]:
**How do we know something is important?** Through **contrast**.
Our brain is programmed to focus on stimuli that stand out.



That I "wasted" so much time configuring my obsidian does not mean that it is complicated, nor does it have to be. It just that I had something very specific in mind and my needs are somewhat unusual.
**You can start using obsidian, have it configured and be familiar with it within a weekend,** if you are motivated.

I read a lot about people struggling with the variety of the offered options and different solutions on how to structure a vault. But I think thats the beauty of it, that there are so many individual ways to build a system that fits their needs and their thinking/work process.

> [!Tip] My Tipp 
> My tipp for people who wanna start using Obsidian is to get inspired by others to a certain point, but to always stick to your own thing and to **never adopt something, just because it works for somebody else** or looks good. Build the system AROUND your workflow, dont try to come up with a system which you would need to adapt to. The system should work for you - not the other way around. Let it grow organically. Only adapt it to new situations, when a new need arises.
