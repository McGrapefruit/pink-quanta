## My weapon of choice against the chaos of life


[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) became my weapon of choice against the chaos in my life.
In this blog I wanna share my experience using Obsidian for every aspect of my life in the past 3 years.

### What is Obsidian

Obsidian is a note app which can be configured and used in a million different ways, from simplistic note-taking to advanced *Information-Management-Systems*. 




There are a lot of reasons of [[Why I use Obsidian|why I use Obsidian]] instead of any other software. 
**Data-sovereignty** (offline data, no vendor lock-in, human readable markdown files which can be imported into every other tool), as well as the **freedom to build any workflow** you come up with, are only a view of the reasons.


==Obsidian is for everybody who writes notes about "stuff" ==(literally anything) ==and wants to keep and easily find those notes again in the future== (future-proof).


Its is great for students/university/Education, (Project) Managers, Assistants, Side-Husslers, Hobbies, (Journal-)Writers etc. â€“ anything that has to do with organisation or writing. If you are already using tools like Evernote, Apple-notes, onenote or similar, you will LOVE Obsidian.

Many new users complain about being overwelmed by the sheere possibilities of customization through different plugins and setups. **In my opinion the obsidian online-community paints a picture of an overly complicated software**. But thats not true at all.

When opening the app for the first time, the app is bare-naked and has only the most necessary functions: 

- Its a simple and *fast* text editor
- Notes created in the app are stored in a local folder on your computer. 
- You can create sub-folders to further structure your notes, while also being able to add Hashtags to individual notes. 
- You also have the option to link related notes together, just like an article in Wikipedia has hyperlinks to related articles within the text.

Thats it. 
Simple UserInterface, no junk. Unused Features can be hidden. Needed Features can be installed through plugins written by the massive community.


Its the massive library of plugins and their interactions, with sheer endless possibilities that can seem like rocketscience. People on the internet explaining how to use obsidian often fail to mention, that their just showing how THEY use obsidian. **There is no right way to use Obsidian**. It has to work for YOU. 
Don't bother trying to mimic a complex system from somebody else on the internet, as you will be violating [[Gall's Law]]. **Keep obsidian as it is: Simple.** And if the need arises, your system will grow organically over time.

### What I use Obsidian for
I use Obsidian to track, document and plan everything I am interested in and want to focus on. Everything, from my work to my personal interests, is neatly organised in one vault.

##### I manage my professional ==work==  

- `task management` 
- `projectmanagement` 
- nearly all business `documentation` of our startup-company
- Marketing
	- whitepaper planning
	- company Info
	- Blogposts


##### But I also use it to organize my ==private== life: 
- `Journal` Notes
- interests & hobbies 
	- `books` I read
	- things I `learn` 
	- `photography` and `art` 
	- `psychology` and QM
- `freelance projects` & `side hussle`,
- `burocracy`

**If you are new to obsidian, don't start with reading about intimidating & complex workflows. Start by only using the basic functions and go from there.**


## Preamble: A word of adwise on How to approach obsidian

> [!warning] Warning: The Dangers of Obsidian
> Obsidian can be highly addictive, functions as a vast rabbithole and can be a massivly effective procrastination tool, since everything you build to be more organized feels so productive. I know what I am talking about :-)
> If you start using Obsidian and are new to the topic, start with learning about the [Pareto-principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
> 
> Also this is just a joke. Have fun and enjoy the ride!  
> 
> **I dont think everybody needs to learn everything**.
> We are a society sharing collective knowledge. If you get stuck, dont waste hours trying to figuring something out, which somebody else might already has accomplished. Visit the obsidian Forum and talk to some people instead! (Don't be a stubborn perfectionist like me).
> If you seek assistance with your Obsidian, you can also hit me up.




I spent a lot of time fiddeling with my obsidian vault, trying out different workflows, restructured my setup countless times and even developed my own system.
**There is a lot I have learned about efficient, future-proof and sustainable structures.**


It easily took me 500+ hours to be where I am at, but ==if I had to start from scratch today, I would be operable in less than a day.==
It took some time to combine my experience from the many PMS I used in the past, but it was worth the effort. At least for my usecase.

**That I "wasted" so much time configuring my obsidian does not mean that it is complicated, nor does it have to be**. It just that I had something very specific in mind and my needs are somewhat unconventional.
==You can start using obsidian, have it configured and be familiar with it within a weekend.==



I read a lot about people struggling with the variety of the offered options and different solutions on how to structure a vault. But I think thats the beauty of it, that there are so many individual ways to build a system that fits their needs and their thinking/work process. You just need to focus on what YOU need and thats what it'll be.

> [!Tip] My Tipp 
> My tipp for people who wanna start using Obsidian is to only get inspired by others to a certain point, but to always stick to your own thing and to **never adopt something, just because it works for somebody else** or looks professional. 
> 
> Build the system AROUND your workflow, dont try to come up with a system which you would need to adapt to. The system should work for you - not the other way around. Let it grow and evolve organically. 
> Start small, dont over complicate. 
> Only tweak the system according to new requirements if the need arises.
