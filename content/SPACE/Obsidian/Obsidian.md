## My weapon of choice against the chaos of life


[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) became my weapon of choice against the chaos in my life.
In this SPACE I wanna share my experience using it for every aspect of my life in the past 3 years.

Obsidian is a note-app which can be configured and used in a million different ways, from simplistic note taking to advanced  Information-Maganement-Systems. There are a lot of reasons of [[Why I use Obsidian - and why you may also want too| why I use Obsidian ]] instead of any other software.

I manage my work (as well as nearly all business documentation of our company), and use it to organize my private life: my interests/ hobbies, side hussles, art projects, burocracy. 
Everything which I am interested in and want to focus is tracked, documented and planned through Obsidian.

In my opinion, **a good system should address and mimic how the human brain is designed:**
We perceive only a fraction of the information we are confronted with by the outside world – the brain filters out 95% of the noise, only making us conscious of relevant stimuli.

A digital system / Life OS, which is used to manage all kind of projects produces a lot of content, which turns to noise if it is not carefully filtered and structured.
At all times it should only provide you with relevant information while also resurfacing old notes, making thoughts salient again, enabeling new connections though meta-cognition.

I spent a lot of time fiddeling with my obsidian vault, spent 500+ of hours trying out different workflows and developing my own system and color-theme, optimizing everything to my needs.
There is a lot I have learned about **efficient, future-proof and sustainable structures**. If I had to start from scratch today, I would be operable in less than a day.

My first tipp for people who wanna start using Obsidian is to get inspired by others to a certain point, but to always stick to your own thing and to **never adopt something, just because it works for somebody else** or looks good. Build the system AROUND your workflow, dont try to come up with a system which you would need to adapt to. ==The system should work for you - not the other way around==. Let it grow organically. Only adapt it to new situations, when a new need arises.
