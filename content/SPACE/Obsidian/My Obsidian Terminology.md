### Terminologies are schemata that make life easier


In the PKM-community many people use terminologies and frameworks to add meaningful information about a note. 

Often times analogies of plants with their evolving states are being used to describe the degree of elaboration/ completion. Some people are calling their new notes "seedlings", while elaborated ones are called "Forest" or "Evergreen".

I like nature, but I am really not a plant person. The only plant which I managed not to kill is my beloved monstera.

So, I wanted something which suits my passion, so I named and built my system on the analogy of physical particles.

### Types of notes / content

Everything starts with a **QUANTUM**, which is a fluctuating thought I wrote down. Either they get linked to other notes, grow and persist, or they die - like a seedling that is not watered - or like the synaptic connection between two neurons that is not being used.
My inbox is structured similarly to the [Hot-cool Inbox](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Atlas/Inbox) from the LYT-framework. That way I keep track of older Quanta and can decide how to proceed with these notes.

Since the obsidian community calls their small Notes "Atomic notes" and the Index notes MOCs (Map of Content) I wanted to stick with this methodology, so that people can relate to it more easily.


So, a small note is called an **ATOM**, many ATOMS linked together form a **MOC** (Molecule) and many molecules together form **SPACE**.

The only thing I added, was a DOC, which has a different purpose than all the other type of notes.


| TYPE | Description | Examples |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ==SPACE== | **Area**  / Topic<br>Can be categorized into physical boxes or happens within a defined environment. Spaces are Dashboards, which add a new layer in order to structure related Mocs. Every space has its own Hashtag and is automatically sorted into the accompanying folder. | Work, Side Hussle, Personal Areas |
| ==MOC== | **Molecule** - Structure of linked DOCs, ATOMs and QUANTAs.<br>Its an INDEX note aka. a "Map Of Content" | Projects, Concepts, Constructs |
| ==DOC== | **Documents** with a definied purpose and structure. Important stuff which need safe keeping<br>Documentations, bureaucracy related stuff etc. | Bureaucracy Docs, Documentation, Formal Letters |
| ==ATOM== | **Atoms** <br>Smallest unit of information that has value on its own (self-contained, isolated Knowledge ) | Wiki-Notes,<br>Article, Tutorial |
| ==QUANTA== | **Virtual particles**<br>Small fluctuating Information (zettels) with unclear goal; thinking on paper. Ideas which spontaneously emerge behave like fragile synapses searching new connections. Such neural networks are getting annihilated over time if they dont interact with another "System", strengthening the synapses. If its is not being linked / incorporated over time, it will be deleted. | IDEA,  Thinking on Paper, "The idea I had when I drank my coffee - dont know what to do with it yet" |
