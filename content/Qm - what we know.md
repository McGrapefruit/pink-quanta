In QM
1. Location and speed tend not to be defined
	1. Exact measurements creating knowledge about both qualities are impossible ([[uncertainty principle]])
2. Quantum Objects can exist in multiple states (or even places) at the same time
	1. Quantum superposition (weird correlation - action from a distance)


Quantum states decay extreamly quickly unless in a vacuum and or near absolut zero temperature.
