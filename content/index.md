Hi there!

Welcome to my *digitalgarden*.
This is a zettelkasten of collective knowledge, curated by me - [[about me|Nikolaus Leonard]].

The purpose of this site is to connect with likeminded people and to discuss ==transdisziplinary insights== and [[Syntopy|syntopic concepts]], combining academia, science and art.

I'm convinced that [[Communication and QM|communication creates a sur-plus]] and that we can achieve amazing things through sharing our knowledge, and having conversations about the things we are each passionate about.

Pleasure to meet you![^1]
