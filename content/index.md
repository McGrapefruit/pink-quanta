Hi there!

The purpose of this site is to connect with likeminded people and to discuss ==transdisziplinary insights== and [[Syntopy|syntopic concepts]], combining academia, science and art – the concept is still evolving[^1]. Inspiration and syntopy is only achievable through interaction.




I am not the sole author of this content. It's a zettelkasten of collective knowledge, curated by me - Nikolaus Leonard.

Pleasure to meet you!

**This site follows one simple rule:**
[[index|Blue is for reference (WHO, WHERE or WHAT)]], ==PINK is the indicator (HOW/WHY).==

## Topics I am interested in +

### Communication
Communication consumes me. I convinced that we can achieve amazing things though  sharing our knowledge and that [[Communication and QM|Communication creates a sur-plus]].

Currently work at [DataHall](https://datahall.de) as Head of Communication.
We are a [[Holacracy|holocratic]] team of planners with the ambitious vision of building the most innovative datacenter in Europe. We are still in stealth mode, a new website and marketing is coming soon! 


### Photography

My later Mentor [[Thomas Degen (THD)|Thomas Degen]], who was a known fashion photographer, sparked my love for *painting with light*.
He only made his money with fashion, but in his heart he was a true artist. Sadly only a small fraction of his works has ever been on display. Especially his late works have never seen the light outside of his studio-basement.

Thomas experienced extraordinary adventures in the 70ies-80ies, most of his stories took place in a world which doesn't exist anymore – Experiences which are no longer possible today. Talking to him was like a history lesson. In fact I learned everything I know about history from him.

Some of the stories I share on this site are in honour of Thomas, as he is sadly no longer able to tell them himself.
We even startet building an Art Agency together, called [[KALEIDOS]] which is not active at the moment due to his death. I inherited his whole archive containing 10s of thousands of dias, negatives and prints, which I will gradually curate, digitize and exhibit.

### Psychology
I studied Psychology for 7 years. With my whole family working mostly in medical and my mom being a therapist I basically grew up with the topic, but I only realized my love for psychology, when I went back to school at the age of 18. I loved it all my life, without knowing. All my interests had a psychological aspect to it. Communication, body language, empathy, negotiation...

I was a professional magician at the time – and what's magic, other than psychology. You manipulate the subjective perception though body language, pulling your focus and attention to the desired aspect, exploiting cognitive blindspots of the human brain.

I did not persuite the career of a therapist as it was my wish when started my studies, tho there is no day where I am not thinking about psychology and related topics.

**Special topics that spark my interest**
- Interpersonal differences between our perception of "reality" (and the philosophical question of what reality is)
- How we humans are biased in our perception about everything 
- How we handle Emotions
- How we approach Goals
- How to get out of the hole





### Quantum Mechanics (QM)
I wrote my thesis in Psychology about [[Quantum Mechanics]] (Title "Versuchsleiter-Erwartungseffekte auf Basis der Quantenmechanik - Explorative Micro-PK-Studie zu (un)willentlicher Beeinflussung eines Quantensystems") – Sounds more advanced than it is. 

Since then I am a great Enthusiast of QM.
I have always been a holistic system thinker, interested in how "systems"  work.

[[Quantum fundamentalism|Everything is made from Quants]] therefore every science-form potentially shows quantum behaviour of some sort (to some extent). You can even find quantum theories in (Micro-)Biology, System Theory, Psychology, and even Buddhism, if you are very creative.

I have the pleasure of being friend with some Quantum-scientists like Marcus Reid @[Quantum Power Munich](https://quantumpowermunich.de/). Everytime we share a beer together I feel like my worldview is getting more and more completed and destroyed at the same time.

In this SPACE I wanna share facts and have conversations about QM in simple understandable bits for anyone who has also not studied physics or mathematics (like myself).






### Obsidian & Digital Knowledge- and Projektmanagement

I am a [[Obsidian]] fanboy, there is no denying it.
Obsidian is a software which helps you to store and connect notes and thoughts in a super simple way. In my opinion the obsidian online-community paints a picture of an overly complicated software, which is aimed at hardcore academics, PKM-Nerds, computer scientists or for Pen&Paper-Gaming/World-building. But thats not true at all.

Obsidian is great for students/university/Education, (Project) Managers, Assistants, Side-Husslers, Hobbies, (Journal-)Writers etc. – anything that has to do with organisation or writing.

Read about [[Why I use Obsidian]]

If you are already using obsidian and have everything figured out and are searching for inspiration, you may be interested in [[My Obsidian System|how my Obsidian Knowledge- and Projektmanagement-System is designed]], which I tailored to my unconventional needs & different purposes.
