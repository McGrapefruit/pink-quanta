Hi there!

The purpose of this site is to connect with likeminded people to talk about ==transdisziplinary insights== and [[Syntopy|syntopic concepts]], combining academia, science and art – with the concept still evolving[^1]. Synthpy is only possible through interaction.

[^1]: Building a lot of wordpress websites for clients in the past, its a unusual feeling for me to publish a site still under maintainence. But thats the idea of an evolving *digital garden*

I am not the sole author of this content. Its a zettelkasten of collective knowledge, curated by me - Nikolaus Leonard.

Pleasure to meet you!

The color-design follows one simple rule:

## Topics I am interested in +



### Communication
Communication consumes me.
I convinced that we can achieve amazing things though  sharing our knowledge and that [[Communication and QM|Communication creates a sur-plus]].

Currently work at [DataHall](https://datahall.de) as Head of Communication.
We are a holistic team of planners with the ambitious vision of building the most innovative datacenter in Europe. We are still in stealth mode, a new website and marketing is coming soon! 

### Obsidian & Digital Knowledge- and Projektmanagement

I am a [[Obsidian]] fanboy, there is no denying it.

My whole circle of friends had to endure me going into raptures about obsidian way to often, I can not torture them any longer.

Here is [[Why I use Obsidian - and why you may also want too]] and [[My Obsidian System| how my Obsidian Knowledge- and Projektmanagement-System]] is designed, which I tailored to my needs &  purposes. 


### Photography

My later Mentor [[Thomas Degen (THD)|Thomas Degen]], who was a known fashion photographer, sparked my love for *painting with light*.
He only made his money with fashion, but in his heart he was a true artist. Sadly only a small fraction of his works was ever on display. Especially his late works have never seen the light outside of his studio-basement.

He experienced many interesting adventures in the 70ies-80ies, most stories telling of a world which is not existent anymore – Experiences which are no longer possible today. Talking to him was like an history lesson. In fact I learned everything I know about history from him.

Some of the stories I share on this site are honour of Thomas, for which he is sadly no longer able to tell them himself.
We even startet building an Art Agency together, called [[KALEIDOS]] which is not active at the moment due to his death. I inherited his whole archive containing 10s of thousands of Dias, negatives and prints, which I will gradually curate, digitize and exhibit.


### Psychology
I studied Psychology for 7 years. With my whole family working mostly in medical and my mom being a therapist I basically grew up with the topic, but I only realized my love for psychology, when I went back to school at the age of 18. I loved it all my life, without knowing. All my interests had a psychological aspect to it. Communication, body language, empathy, negotiation...

I was a professional magician at the time – and what's magic, other than psychology. You manipulate the subjective perception though body language, pulling your focus and attention to the desired aspect, exploiting cognitive blindspots of the human brain.

I did not persuite the career of a therapist as it was my wish when started my studies, tho there is no day where I am not thinking about psychology and related topics.

**Special topics that spark my interest**
- Interpersonal differences between our perception of "reality" (and the philosophical question of what reality is)
- How we humans are biased in our perception about everything 
- How we handle Emotions
- How we approach Goals
- How to get out of the hole





### Quantum Mechanics (QM)
I wrote my thesis in Psychology about [[Quantum Mechanics]] (Title "Versuchsleiter-Erwartungseffekte auf Basis der Quantenmechanik - Explorative Micro-PK-Studie zu (un)willentlicher Beeinflussung eines Quantensystems") – Sounds more advanced than it is. 

Since then I am a great Enthusiast of QM.
I have always been a holistic system thinker, interested in how "systems"  work.

[[Quantum fundamentalism|Everything is made from Quants]] therefore every science-form potentially shows quantum behaviour of some sort (to some extent). You can even find quantum theories in (Micro-)Biology, System Theory, Psychology, and even Buddhism, if you are very creative.

I have the pleasure of being friend with some Quantum-scientists like Marcus Reid @[Quantum Power Munich](https://quantumpowermunich.de/).
Everytime we share a beer together I feel like my worldview is getting more and more completed and destroyed at the same time.

In this SPACE I wanna share facts and have conversations about QM in simple understandable bits for anyone who has also not studied physics or mathematics (like myself).
