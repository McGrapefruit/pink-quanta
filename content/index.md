Hi there!

Welcome to my *digitalgarden*.
This is a zettelkasten of collective knowledge, curated by me - [[about me|Nikolaus Leonard]].

The purpose of this site is to connect with likeminded people and to discuss ==transdisziplinary insights== and [[Syntopy|syntopic concepts]], combining academia, science and art.

I'm convinced that [[Communication and QM|communication creates a sur-plus]] and that we can achieve amazing things through sharing our knowledge, and having conversations about the things we are each passionate about.

Pleasure to meet you![^1]

### How to use this site



**Consider using this site in darkmode**, to fully emerse with the content. (Use the sun/moon icon near the search function)

The site follows one simple design rule:
[[spaces|Click-able links are blue, they provide reference (who, what & where)]], ==pink is the indicator (how / why)==


Rather than long linear articles, the site consists of many shorter, but interconnected notes which together form a *digital-neural-network* that grows over time. 

This enables a special kind of reading experience, where you can **choose your own path through the rabbithole of curated information**. Follow your curiosity whereever it may lead you.

On the right sidebar (or bottom if you are on mobile ) you find Backlinks to related notes. If you are on Desktop, use the graphview to discover more related topics. The search function provides fulltext-search over all pages â€“ use keyword to find your way around.
